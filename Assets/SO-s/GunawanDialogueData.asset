    ourQuestion: What's your name?
    npcQuestionResponse:
    - "Hah? You\u2019re asking my name now? We\u2019ve been sitting here for long
      enough."
    - "It\u2019s Gunawan. That\u2019s all you need to know."
    - "Don\u2019t waste my time with small talk."

      responseToOurChoice:
      - Hah. Your name? Seriously?
      - Oh please. Why would I waste brain space on that?
      - "Nah. I\u2019ll just call you\u2026 Pebble."
      - Yeah, that works. Small, kinda useless, but always in the way.
      - So get used to it, Pebble.
      - "I\u2019m not calling you anything else."

    ourQuestion: What do you remember before all this?
    npcQuestionResponse:
    - "Tch. Of course you\u2019d ask that."
    - What do you think I remember?
    - Nothing useful, if you must know.
    - I was at work. Doing my job like always.
    - Then I blacked out. Just like that.
    - Woke up in this stupid room with you people.
    - No ransom. No demands. No warning. Just some lousy note telling us to find
      an impostor.
    - Ridiculous.
    - "Look, I don\u2019t care about the details."
    - "Whoever dragged me into this is gonna regret it. That\u2019s all that matters."

      responseToOurChoice:
      - "Tch. What\u2019s with that look, Pebble?"
      - "You think if you stare long enough I\u2019ll spill something"
      - "I already told you. I was at work. I blacked out. That\u2019s it."
      - "...Tch. You\u2019re really not gonna drop this, huh?"
      - Fine. You want something? Here, let me tell you something
      - "There was\u2026 a letter. On my desk."
      - "Didn\u2019t open it. Just saw my name on it. Next thing I know *bam* I found
        three brats in front of me."
      - "That\u2019s all you\u2019re getting.  Don\u2019t push your luck."

    ourQuestion: Do you know the others?
    npcQuestionResponse:
    - You mean those two clowns?
    - That calm guy?
    - "I\u2019m calling him Brick Wall."
    - You talk, you push, you poke.. nothing.
    - No cracks, no reactions. Useless.
    - "I don\u2019t trust walls. They either hide something or fall on you when you
      least expect it."
    - "And that shaky girl? She\u2019s Bubble."
    - Soft, weightless, one poke and pop!
    - "She\u2019s not a threat. She\u2019s just there. Floating around, looking scared,
      waiting for someone else to make decisions."
    - And you?
    - Still Pebble.
    - "You\u2019re not dangerous, you\u2019re just in the way."

    ourQuestion: Who do you think is the impostor? If there is one
    npcQuestionResponse:
    - "Tch. Of course one of them\u2019s the impostor."
    - "And I\u2019ve got my eyes on Brick Wall."
    - "Hah That guy? something\u2019s off about him."
    - "He\u2019s too calm, too steady."
    - "People don\u2019t stay that cool unless they know they\u2019re in control."
    - "Unless they\u2019ve got something to hide."
    - "I\u2019ve met his type before."
    - Poker face, always thinking three steps ahead.
    - "They\u2019re usually the ones pulling the strings."
    - "He\u2019s sitting there, watching us like we\u2019re pieces on his game board."

    - ourChoice: What about the girl?
      responseToOurChoice:
      - "Bubble? Please. She\u2019s harmless."
      - "She\u2019s just sitting there, shaking like she\u2019s about to break."
      - " If she\u2019s the impostor, then this whole thing\u2019s a joke."
      - And you, Pebble?
      - "You\u2019re barely a speed bump."
      - "Can\u2019t even bother suspecting you right now."
      - "Nah, it\u2019s Brick Wall."
      - "I\u2019d bet on it."
      - Something about that guy just screams "trap."

    ourQuestion: What would you do if you were the impostor?
    npcQuestionResponse:
    - "Hah. Let me guess\u2026"
    - "You\u2019re wondering what I\u2019d do if I was the impostor, huh?"
    - HAHAHHAHAHA you think i would idly sit right here
    - "Nah I\u2019d win."
    - "I wouldn\u2019t waste time playing nice."
    - "I\u2019d move fast, hit hard, and make sure no one ever saw it coming."
    - So yeah. If I was the impostor, Pebble?
    - "You wouldn\u2019t be sitting there right now."

    ourQuestion: Do you care about any of us?
    npcQuestionResponse:
    - Hah? Care? About them?
    - Listen, Pebble.
    - "This isn\u2019t some heartwarming team building exercise."
    - "I don\u2019t need to care. I just need to live."
    - "That\u2019s the whole point, right?"
    - "Brick Wall? Can\u2019t trust him."

      responseToOurChoice:
      - "Bubble? She\u2019ll crumble with or without me."
      - "What\u2019s there to care about?"
      - "I didn\u2019t come here with friends. I\u2019m not leaving with any."
      - "That\u2019s how I survive games like this."
      - "What? You hoping I\u2019ll say something nice?"
      - "Sorry, Pebble. That\u2019s not in my vocabulary."
