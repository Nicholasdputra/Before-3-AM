    ourQuestion: Do you remember anything before getting here?
    npcQuestionResponse:
    - The only thing I remember is working on some code at home.
    - Just another all-nighter.
    - ...
    - Actually.. something weird did happen...
    - I found no bugs in my code. Weird right?
    - "Haha jokes aside. that\u2019s all I can remember."

    npcQuestionResponse:
    - "Oh! that\u2019s what\u2019s bothering you?"
    - Fair enough
    - If I had to give you a reason...
    - "Even when things are weird\u2026 panic never helps, right?"
    - "Besides\u2026 I get the feeling we\u2019re being watched."
    - And being calm helps me remain vigilant

    npcQuestionResponse:
    - Hmm.. Good question.
    - "Honestly? i don\u2019t know."
    - Cold walls, no windows, just creepy notes in the center.
    - Maybe we got kidnapped?... probably, but...
    - Y'know it almost feels like we are in a game..
    - Like a horror simulator game or in the backrooms hahaha
    - But hey, maybe I'm just overthinking it.

    ourQuestion: Could you tell me more about your work?
    npcQuestionResponse:
    - "Oh, my job?  I\u2019m a game programmer."
    - Basically I kinda just make sure that my game works as intended
    - By making the back end of it, likeee making an engine for a car to make sure
      it can move
    - As for what I usually make...
    - I really like making story based games, with its own set of rules
    - Then I like trying to break those rules myself.
    - "Unpredictable glitches, weird edge cases\u2026 just to see how the game reacts."
    - You can learn a lot about a system when you break it.
    - You can learn even more about it when you put them in said game
    - They always seem to come up with the most creative things to do

    ourQuestion: Do you know the others?
    npcQuestionResponse:
    - Oh, them?
    - "I\u2019ve never met them before"
    - "The girl, she seems super nervous, but who wouldn\u2019t be in this situation."
    - That man... Honestly he looks like he'd get angry, if you talked to him.
    - I don't think they know each other either
    - Speaking of... you've been asking me an awful lot of questions...
    - Not that mind of course but... Hm... Well I suppose it's normal to be curious
    - Especially in this position we're in. I'd also ask around but...
    - I think the girl's too nervous around people and the guy... he seems to have
      something against me...

    ourQuestion: Who do you think brought us here?
    npcQuestionResponse:
    - Honestly, I'm not sure
    - A normal kidnapper would want something. Money perhaps, or revenge.
    - But this? No ransom. No demands. No communication.
    - "Just\u2026 silence and a game."
    - "That\u2019s why I think this isn\u2019t a kidnapping."
    - It almost feels like they just want to see how people react in this situation...
    - How they react, how they interact with others...
    - Hm....

    ourQuestion: What do you think about the situation?
    npcQuestionResponse:
    - Hmm, I read the notes earlier, about there being someone among us responsible
      for this
    - "Yeah\u2026 It\u2019s pretty messed up when you think about it."
    - "Waking up with a note like that, no explanation, no exit\u2026"
    - "It\u2019s like someone\u2019s playing with us."
    - "Watching how fast we\u2019ll turn on each other."
    - "But you know what\u2019s interesting?"
    - The impostor might not even need to do anything.
    - 'Just drop that one sentence: "One of us is the impostor"'
    - "\u2026and let paranoia do the rest."
    - "It\u2019s kind of brilliant, in a really dark way."
    - but of course, it sucks for us.

    ourQuestion: Who do you think is the liar among us?
    npcQuestionResponse:
    - ...
    - You want to know who I think the impostor is?
    - I wanna say the man just because of how angry he is...
    - Maybe he set this whole thing up but ended up getting stuck in here, hence
      why he's upset
    - "But sometimes people like him act that way because they\u2019re scared of
      losing control."
    - "Not because they\u2019re hiding something."
    - "That girl\u2026 she\u2019s afraid of something."
    - "Whether she\u2019s guilty or not\u2026 I'm not sure though"
    - "Her fear isn\u2019t fake, but that doesn't mean she's necessarily innocent
      either"
    - "If you\u2019re asking for a name\u2026"
    - "I don\u2019t have one yet and I don't really wanna guess"
    - Not when the cost of being wrong could be everything.
    - That said.... if I really needed to pick a person to vote out, it'd probably
      be Renatta
    - I think she's afraid because she messed up and is now trapped with us despite
      being the impostor
    - That said, again, I'm really not sure.

    ourQuestion: Y'know... the way you've been talking about things...
    npcQuestionResponse:
    - Hmm? What about it?
    - I guess I think there's a part of me that thinks that this would make an interesting
      game
    - Maybe that's my way of coping with thing, kinda just relating it all back to
      work
    - Hmm....
    - Honestly, the design of this place...
    - Whoever made this, they definitely know how to mess with people.
    - "Dropping random strangers in a room, leave a single line \u201COne of you
      is the impostor.\u201D"
    - No traps... No need for weapons... Just doubt...
    - And humans? We destroy ourselves with that alone.
    - Every decision that we make here seems to come at a cost
    - The cost of time, cost of the others' trust and favorability, and... the cost
      of one of our lives later
    - The faster you point fingers, the more others fear and dislike you.
    - But the longer you take the more the others doubt you.
    - Time. Trust. Sanity.
    - You always pay something.
    - Which is unsettling...

    ourQuestion: What would you do if you were the impostor
    npcQuestionResponse:
    - If I were the impostor?
    - ' Honestly? Nothing that different from what I''m doing now'
    - Though of course, I'm not the impostor.
    - "But I\u2019d try to make sure no one ever found out."
    - Not through lies, not through trickery.
    - But by making others trust me and feel safe around me.

    - ourChoice: Why are you telling me this though?
      responseToOurChoice:
      - Well, I don't want you to fall for it, in case the others try to do that
        to you
      - You should keep an objective approach. Keep thinking, keep questioning everyone...
        even me.
      - Hmm, back to your question, if i were the impostor...
      - I'd hope you'd find out and stop me
      - For everyone's sake.
